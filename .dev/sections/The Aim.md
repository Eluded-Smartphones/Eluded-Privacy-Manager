# The Aim:
This Project Aims To Combine:
- [Wasted](https://github.com/x13a/Wasted)
- [CalyX Firewall](https://gitlab.com/MarleyPlant/platform-packages-apps-securityfeatures)
- [Scrambled EXIF](https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif)
- [Duress](https://github.com/x13a/Duress)
- [Mission Control](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.kollnig.missioncontrol.fdroid/)
- [Network Ghost](https://github.com/souramoo/NetworkGhost)

With a more user-friendly interface 
which allows someone not so technical to configure privacy-friendly features:

## Features
* Network Routing
* Tracker Management
* Get Notified of potential threats
* Panic Wipe
     * fire when a device was not unlocked for X time
     * fire when a USB data connection is made while a device is locked
     * fire when a fake messenger app is launched
     * fire when a specific lock pattern is entered.
     * fire when a secretcode is found in notifications

Eventually the aim is to merge into [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/)

Be aware that the app does not work in _safe mode_.
